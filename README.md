# ImageAnalysis
Android application for simple image modifications

# What works
1. Loading image from camera and folder,
2. Saving image,
3. Menu where user can choose modification type,
4. FABs for selecting images,
5. Binarization, Watershed, Canny, GrabCut, Meanshift, all using OpenCV
6. Slider for manipulating Watershed, Canny and Binarization.

# What should be done
1. AsyncTask for all modifications (branched),
2. UI changes (remove menu and add something more usable),
3. GrabCut is taking constants now, need to change to user selection,
4. Meanshift is only mean, need to modify to add a segmentation element,
5. Maybe more modifications in the future.
